# Zeal Commander

Zeal Commander (or `zc`) is a visual file manager.
It is heavily inspired by [Midnight Commander](https://midnight-commander.org/).

Zeal Commander is a full-screen, text-mode program that allows you
to copy, move, and delete files and entire directory trees, search for files, and execute programs.

## Installation

Use `xfer.py` to transfer `zc.bin` to your Zeal 8-bit Computer.

```
xfer.py -s -v -f bin/zc.bin
```

## Building from source

Make sure that you have [ZDE](https://github.com/zoul0813/zeal-dev-environment) installed.

Then open a terminal, go to the source directory and type the following commands:

```shell
    $ zde restart
    $ zde make
```
